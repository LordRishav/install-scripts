Errors may arise further, I'm only a beginner. You may wish to edit the script to how you want it.
I have tried to make these as universal as possible.

## These scripts are not for total beginners, rather they are targeted towards people who can manually install Arch Linux.

# Remember: manual steps >> scripts in terms of security usability etc.

## To do

-[ ] Add options for locales
-[ ] Add options for languages
-[ ] Add options for countries in reflector
