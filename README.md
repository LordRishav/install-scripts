# Read the script you are going to execute before executing it.

Errors may arise. Further, I'm only a beginner. You may wish to edit the script to how you want it.
I have tried to make these as universal as possible and I only include new stuff when I'm sure it works.

## These scripts are not for total beginners, rather they are targeted towards people who can manually install Arch Linux.
Now, installing Arch doesn't exactly make you a pro, these scripts are an attempt at automating stuff you are supposed to do manually

# Remember: manual steps >> scripts in terms of security usability etc.

## To do

uefi-install/universal-uefi/bios-install

- [ ] Change permissions of wheel group

sway-wayland

- [ ] Ask for browser
- [ ] set browser selected as $BROWSER
- [ ] ask preferred terminal name and install it. Set `$term terminal name` in sway config
- [ ] Ask for preferred shell. If blank continue with rest of script
- [ ] Ask for pulseaudio/pipewire
